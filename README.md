# TSP Evolutionary Computation
Travel Salesman Problem solution using Evolutionary computation

This application is used to solve Travel Salesman Problem using Evolutionary computation for [TSPLIB95](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) files.
The application allows to use several configurations and parameters for each algorithm.

To use the application, run the evolutiveAlgorithm.jar executable and select the configuration and parameters that you want.

To run the algorithm, first you must to choose instances of TSPLIB95 and click on "Ejecutar".
After the algorithm finishes (the time depends of the configuration), the button "Resultados finales" will be available and show the resultant file.
